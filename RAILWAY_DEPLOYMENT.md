# Railway Deployment Guide for TIPSI

## 🚀 Quick Fix Summary

Your TIPSI app has been updated to fix Railway deployment issues:

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
1. **Port binding**: Now properly binds to `0.0.0.0` for Railway
2. **Duplicate routes**: Removed duplicate `/test` endpoint
3. **Graceful shutdown**: Added proper signal handling for Railway
4. **Build configuration**: Updated Railway config and build scripts
5. **Health checks**: Ensured `/health` endpoint works properly

### 🔧 Key Changes Made:

#### 1. Backend Server (`backend/src/index.ts`)
- Fixed server binding to `0.0.0.0:${PORT}` for Railway compatibility
- Added graceful shutdown handlers for SIGTERM/SIGINT
- Removed duplicate test endpoint
- Enhanced logging for Railway deployment

#### 2. Railway Configuration (`railway.json`)
- Updated port to 3000 (matches your app)
- Added custom build command
- Configured proper health checks

#### 3. Build Scripts
- Created `railway-build.sh` for Railway-specific builds
- Updated package.json with Railway build commands
- Added proper Prisma client generation

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment issues"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Railway Dashboard
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Select your TIPSI project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Deploy Latest" or wait for auto-deploy

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Railway:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `NODE_ENV`: `production`
- `PORT`: Railway will set this automatically

### 4. Monitor Deployment
- Check the build logs for any errors
- Verify the health check at `/health` endpoint
- Monitor the application logs

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check if TypeScript compilation succeeds
- Verify Prisma client generation
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

### App Won't Start
- Check if port binding is correct
- Verify environment variables
- Check application logs for errors

### Health Check Fails
- Ensure `/health` endpoint is accessible
- Check if database connection works
- Verify server is binding to correct address

## 📱 Testing Your Deployed App

### Health Check
```
GET https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

### Test Endpoint
```
GET https://your-app.railway.app/test
```

### Database Health
```
GET https://your-app.railway.app/health/db
```

## 🛠️ Manual Build (if needed)

If Railway build fails, you can build locally and push:

```bash
# Build backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run build

# Verify build
ls -la dist/

# Commit and push
git add backend/dist/
git commit -m "Add pre-built backend"
git push origin main
```

## 📞 Support

If you continue to have issues:
1. Check Railway build logs
2. Verify environment variables
3. Test health endpoints
4. Check application logs in Railway dashboard

## 🎯 Expected Result

After deployment, your app should:
- ✅ Build successfully on Railway
- ✅ Start without port binding errors
- ✅ Respond to health checks
- ✅ Be accessible via Railway URL
- ✅ Handle graceful shutdowns
