# ðŸš€ TIPSI Railway Deployment Checklist

## âœ… Pre-Deployment Verification

### 1. Code Fixes Applied
- [x] Fixed server binding to `0.0.0.0` for Railway compatibility
- [x] Removed duplicate `/test` endpoint
- [x] Added graceful shutdown handlers
- [x] Updated Railway configuration
- [x] Created Railway build script
- [x] Verified local build works

### 2. Files Modified
- [x] `backend/src/index.ts` - Server configuration
- [x] `railway.json` - Railway deployment config
- [x] `package.json` - Build scripts
- [x] `railway-build.sh` - Custom build script
- [x] `.railwayignore` - Build optimization
- [x] `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide

### 3. Local Testing
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] Railway build script works
- [x] Prisma client generation successful
- [x] Build output verified

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment issues - server binding, build scripts, graceful shutdown"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Railway Dashboard
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Select your TIPSI project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Deploy Latest" or wait for auto-deploy

### Step 3: Monitor Build
- Watch build logs for any errors
- Ensure Prisma client generation succeeds
- Verify TypeScript compilation
- Check if `backend/dist/index.js` is created

### Step 4: Verify Deployment
- Health check: `GET /health`
- Test endpoint: `GET /test`
- Database health: `GET /health/db`

## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in Railway:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to `production`
- `PORT` - Railway sets this automatically

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

After successful deployment:
- âœ… App builds without errors
- âœ… Server starts on Railway-assigned port
- âœ… Health checks respond correctly
- âœ… App accessible via Railway URL
- âœ… Graceful shutdowns work

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails:
1. Check Railway build logs
2. Verify Node.js version (should be 20)
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed
4. Check Prisma schema and client generation

### If App Won't Start:
1. Verify environment variables
2. Check if port binding is correct
3. Review application logs
4. Ensure database connection works

### If Health Check Fails:
1. Check if `/health` endpoint is accessible
2. Verify server is running
3. Check application logs for errors

## ðŸ“± Testing URLs

Replace `your-app.railway.app` with your actual Railway domain:

- **Health Check**: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- **Test Endpoint**: `https://your-app.railway.app/test`
- **Database Health**: `https://your-app.railway.app/health/db`

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria

Your TIPSI app is successfully deployed on Railway when:
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] Server starts and binds to correct port
- [ ] Health checks return 200 OK
- [ ] App is accessible via Railway URL
- [ ] All endpoints respond correctly
